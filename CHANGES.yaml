      previously searched for query.
- 1.2.0:
    - >
      New Feature: Machine View!

      The Juju GUI now provides two views of your environment. In addition to
      the service view there is not a new machine view. It will list out the
      underlying machines in your environment along with the services deployed
      on those machines. Machine view allows you to manually place services
      onto machines and containers on providers that support network access to
      containers.

      Along with the new machine view is a new deployer bar. This bottom bar
      allows you to stage up multiple changes to your environment before
      committing them to the Juju environment. This lets you add many
      machines, add services, and place them carefully, and verify your list
      of changes before any requests are made to Juju.

      our reliance on the Object.observe polyfill.
    - >
      Under the "mv" flag, work continues on the machine view and a deployer and
      an environment change-set which allows all changes to be queued up and
      then committed at once. Uncommitted indicators added to all juju
      primitives, and much styling work around getting the upcoming Machine View
      ready for daily use.

      Safari is now a first class browser. You can use it without any notice
      about it being unsupported and it's built into our current CI testing.
    - >
      The GUI will now start to provide notifications of bundle deployments
      that were already in progress before you opened the GUI. This means that
      if you deply a bundle via quickstart, after you log into the GUI, you'll
      still get notifications of the bundles success or failure.
    - >
      The GUI will no longer export itself. This is to prevent issues in
      reusing your bundle file that is generated with juju-quickstart or

      includes a new panel and tokens to represent machines and units of
      services to place on specific machines.
    - >
      Add flag "il" for moving the inspector into the left sidebar. This also
      brings in work for a deployer bar to allow users to build a collection
      of changes to deploy at one time.

- 0.12.0:
    - >
      (BETA) In arguably the biggest single new feature of the GUI since its
      release, the GUI now supports importing, exporting, browsing and
      deploying "bundles". Bundles are collections of charms and their
      relations. You can export bundles using the export icon at the top of
      the GUI (an arrow pointing up out of a box) or shift-d. You can import
      them using the import icon (an arrow pointing into the box), by
      dragging yaml files from your computer and dropping then onto the
      environment, or by deploying bundles found in the store.

      The bundle functionality is based on the juju-deployer
      (https://launchpad.net/juju-deployer). Deploying a bundle using the GUI
      currently only support bundles that use charms from the charm store,
      rather than local charms. Some of the GUI functionality assembles
      previously-released functionality, and some of it is brand new, and only
      available before behind feature flags.
    - Add new build mode onboarding information for first time users.
    - Add the ability to deploy straight from quicksearch results.
    - Reduce the overall sprite and css sizes providing a significant improvement
    - >
      Remove footer from the UI and improve the header design providing more room
      for the environment.
    - >
      Improve the environment export to be a valid bundle file.
      in first page load times.
    - Update to the charmworld v3 api with support for bundles as well.
    - (FIX) Improve font rendering for OSX users.
    - (FIX) Correct the cookie warning layout.
    - (FIX) Fix IE10 reloading when upgrade charm is selected.

- 0.11.0:
    - >
      The inspector (and the GUI, for the first time) supports upgrading or
      downgrading a service's charm.
    - >
      The masthead's UX is improved, notably giving a bit more room for the
      rest of the application.
    - Relations now display the names of both endpoints in the environment.
    - >
      The GUI distribution is now about 1/9 the size it was before, speeding
      up deployment.
    - >
      Recommended charms (and bundles) are now marked with a red triangle,
      per results from UX tests.
    - >
      (FIX, CLEANUP) Service coordinates were being stored in three places,
      leading to confusion and bugs.  This code was refactored, introducing
      many fixes to our service positioning behavior.
    - >
      (FIX) If the charm browser were fully open to show charm details, and
      the browser was minimized and then reopened, the details page would be
      blank.
    - >
      (FIX) The Go implementation of the sandbox always lost the first delta
      from the AllWatcher's Next method.
    - >
      (FIX) Bundle export should not include the number of units for
      subordinates.
    - (FIX) Inspector scale up input was disabled forever after value change.
    - (FIX) Charm details link was not working correctly from inspector.
    - (FIX) Unit details did not display exposed URL links properly.
    - (FIX) Position annotations are once again included in exports.
    - (FIX) New units added to the canvas no longer overlap old ones.
    - >
      (FIX) The charm "code" tab in the charm browser now sorts filenames by
      directory and name, to make it easier to find a particular file.  It
      also excludes the svg files from the list, since the rendering was less
      than valuable.
    - >
      (CHARM FIX) This is actually a fix in the charm, but it is an important
      one that is worth calling out.  In some environments, the GUI would
      break, not allowing proper inspection, export, or other basic behavior.
      This turned out to be because the new server had an issue with non-ascii
      values in some cases.
    - >
      Behind the "charmworldv3" flag, bundle support is ready for
      demonstration, including browsing and deploying, in the sandbox and in a
      live environment.  Tweaks, bug fixes, and some approved bundles should
      take us the rest of the way soon.  This comprised a very large portion
      of the work behind this release.
    - >
      Behind the "onboard" flag, the GUI has work to show helpful onboarding
      for new users.
- 0.10.1:
    - Add icon for exporting a bundle.
    - (FIX) The GUI was unusable when cookies were turned off in your browser.
    - >
      (CLEANUP) Use service model in ghost inspector, rather than charm model.
      This is a nice cleanup and also enables a true environment-wide "save"
      button in the future.
    - (FIX) The GUI was unable to deploy charms without config options.
    - (FIX) Remove unit button did not work in Juju Core.
    - >
      (FIX) The inspector's unit view did not update when the unit's values
      changed.  Now everything except for the relations updates.  Relations
      have other issues that, in part, need in-progress changes in Juju Core
      to work.
    - (FIX) Changing settings did not work in Juju Core.
    - >
      (FIX) Removed broken and largely unnecessary "All Notifications" link.
      More, better changes will come there soon.
    - >
      (CLEANUP) As part of bundle work, clean up some browser templates for
      general improvements and for better re-use.
    - >
      (FIX) After saving a service config, old, unchanged values would seem
      to disappear, and then reappear a few seconds later.
    - >
      (CLEANUP) Remove the serviceInspector flag code and some of the
      now-irrelevant old view code.
    - >
      (FIX) if a service is destroyed in the command line, the inspector
      should close when the service disappears.
    - >
      (FIX) subordinate charms should not show constraints and should not
      seem to allow control of scaling.
    - >
      (FIX) destroying a service would hide it too soon, causing surprises if
      the destruction failed.  It now disappears when it is destroyed.
    - >
      Behind upgradeCharm feature flag, complete implementation of support for
      upgrading a charm in the GUI.  This will be released in 0.11, very soon.
    - >
      Behind charmworldv3 feature flag, add more support for bundles (model,
      search results, featured list, initial token, better sandbox support,
      etc.).

This doesn't take in to consideration that you'll be scaling at all. However, it will allow you to use WordPress free of any troubles and pesky limitations that typically happen during \"optimized\". While you _can_ scale out with this setting I encourage you read the README \"optimized\" will give you a hardened WordPress setup. Some of the features in the Admin panel will be locked down and theme edits/plugins can only be updated through he charm. This is the recommended setup for those who are in serious need of constant scaling. \n",

    "description": "Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and\nrun applications that process vast amounts of data.\n.\nHere's what makes Hadoop especially useful:\n.\n* Scalable: Hadoop can reliably store and process petabytes.\n* Economical: It distributes the data and processing across clusters\n  of commonly available computers. These clusters can number\n  into the thousands of nodes.\n* Efficient: By distributing the data, Hadoop can process it in parallel\n  on the nodes where the data is located. This makes it\n  extremely rapid.\n* Reliable: Hadoop automatically maintains multiple copies of data and\n  automatically redeploys computing tasks based on failures.\n.\nHadoop implements MapReduce, using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).\nMapReduce divides applications into many small blocks of work. HDFS creates\nmultiple replicas of data blocks for reliability, placing them on compute\nnodes around the cluster. MapReduce can then process the data where it is\nlocated.\n",

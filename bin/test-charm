# This script expects that the system has python-shelltoolbox and py-juju
# installed:
# sudo apt-get install python-shelltoolbox juju

# This script will deploy the charm, using an alternate origin if given.  All
# arguments that are accepted by lib/deploy_charm_for_testing.py are
# recognized.  --origin and --charm are especially useful.  See
# docs/continuous-integration.rst for more information.

# If FAIL_FAST is set to 1 in the environment, the testing loop will exit when
# the first tested browser returns a failure, rather than trying them all.

# If NO_DESTROY is set, the juju environment will not be destroyed at the end
# of the test run.

# If APP_URL is set, rather than creating/destroying a juju environment for
# testing, the suite will use the given URL.

/*
 * We aggregate and minimize the JavaScript sources in order to improve the
 * load speed of the application.
 *
 * We don't want to use the YUI combo loader feature because we want to be able
 * to run from only static files and we want to be able to run behind a
 * firewall without access to the internet.
 *
 * The final product will provide three JavaScript files: one for the YUI
 * dependencies, one for our custom JavaScript code and one for third party
 * JavaScript like D3.
 *
 * Known issues:
 * (1) If we set "bootstrap=false" in the GlobalConfig object, YUI disables the
 *     loader object. It means it will not even try to download modules. We
 *     cannot  do it because the loader also manages the "use" property which
 *     defines aliases for some of your modules ('juju-views' and
 *     'juju-controllers').
 * (2) During development, we've noticed that some of the YUI modules weren't
 *     included in the list of YUI files (lang/datatype-date-format_en-US,
 *     parallel, app-transitions-native, gallery-markdown, loader-base). For
 *     some reason, the loader does not resolve the names of the files for
 *     these modules. We need to add them manually in this file.
